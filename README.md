# wtfcode
WTFCode. A very bare-bones, and very impractical programming language, with an interpreter written in JavaScript. 

# Why?
Because I want to.

# How?
WTFCode is a language that focuses more on words than other characters. The language is meant to be as impractical as possible.

You can find the latest documentation here: https://esolangs.org/wiki/WTFCode

# Using it
WTFCode is used kinda like JavaScript, in an HTML document. To get started, include the WTFCode interpreter in your document, by placing this anywhere in it.

```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asicosilomu/wtfcode/main/wtfcode.js"></script>
```

After that, create your script. It must be an inline script, as remote sources are not supported as of yet. Create a script tag anywhere in your document, and give it the type of ```text/wtfcode```.

```
<script type="text/wtfcode">
  include local/ostream
  show log string "Hello, World!"
 </script>
 ```
 
 Type your code within the script tags. Have fun!

# WTFCode 1.5.0
A terrible "programming" language by Asicosilomu. This is just the interpreter.
