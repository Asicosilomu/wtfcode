# wtfcode
WTFCode. A very bare-bones, and very impractical programming language, with an interpreter written in JavaScript. Open the HTML file and call the window.WTFCode.evaluate(code) function to evaluate some code.

# Why?
Because I want to.

# How?
WTFCode is a language that focuses more on words than other characters. The language is meant to be as impractical as possible.

A terrible "programming" language by Asicosilomu. This is just the interpreter.
